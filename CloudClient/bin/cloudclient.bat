@REM VMware by You in writing during the Warranty Period. If VMware
@REM determines that it is unable to correct the error or replace the Software,
@REM VMware will refund to You the amount paid by You for that Software, in
@REM which case the License for that Software will terminate.
@REM
@REM 7.2	Software Disclaimer of Warranty.  OTHER THAN THE
@REM WARRANTY ABOVE, AND TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY
@REM APPLICABLE LAW, VMWARE AND ITS SUPPLIERS MAKE NO OTHER
@REM EXPRESS WARRANTIES UNDER THIS EULA, AND DISCLAIM ALL

@REM
@REM 8.	    INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INDEMNIFICATION.
@REM
@REM 8.1	Defense and Indemnification.  Subject to the remainder of this
@REM Section 8 (Intellectual Property Indemnification), VMware shall defend You
@REM against any third party claim that the Software infringes any patent,
@REM trademark or copyright of such third party, or misappropriates a trade

@REM Your actions) under the laws of: (a) the United States and Canada; (b) the
@REM European Economic Area; (c) Australia; (d) New Zealand; (e) Japan; or (f)
@REM the People's Republic of China, to the extent that such countries are part
@REM of the Territory for the License ("Infringement Claim") and indemnify You
@REM from the resulting costs and damages finally awarded against You to such
@REM third party by a court of competent jurisdiction or agreed to in settlement.
@REM The foregoing obligations are applicable only if You:  (i) promptly notify
@REM VMware in writing of the Infringement Claim; (ii) allow VMware sole control
@REM over the defense for the claim and any settlement negotiations; and (iii)
@REM reasonably cooperate in response to VMware requests for assistance.
@REM You may not settle or compromise any Infringement Claim without the
@REM prior written consent of VMware.
@REM
@REM 8.2	Remedies.  If the alleged infringing Software become, or in
@REM VMware's opinion be likely to become, the subject of an Infringement
@REM Claim, VMware will, at VMware's option and expense, do one of the
@REM following:  (a) procure the rights necessary for You to make continued use
@REM of the affected Software; (b) replace or modify the affected Software to
@REM make it non-infringing; or (c) terminate the License to the affected
@REM Software and discontinue the related support services, and, upon Your
@REM certified deletion of the affected Software, refund: (i) the fees paid by You
@REM for the License to the affected Software, less straight-line depreciation
@REM over a three (3) year useful life beginning on the date such Software was
@REM delivered; and (ii) any pre-paid service fee attributable to related support
@REM services to be delivered after the date such service is stopped. Nothing in
@REM this Section 8.2 (Remedies) shall limit VMware's obligation under Section
@REM 8.1 (Defense and Indemnification) to defend and indemnify You, provided
@REM that You replace the allegedly infringing Software upon VMware's making
@REM alternate Software available to You and/or You discontinue using the
@REM allegedly infringing Software upon receiving VMware's notice terminating
@REM the affected License.
@REM
@REM 8.3	Exclusions.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, VMware will have no
@REM obligation under this Section 8 (Intellectual Property Indemnification) or
@REM otherwise with respect to any claim based on:  (a) a combination of
@REM Software with non-VMware products (other than non-VMware products
@REM that are listed on the Order and used in an unmodified form); (b) use for a
@REM purpose or in a manner for which the Software was not designed; (c) use
@REM of any older version of the Software when use of a newer VMware version
@REM would have avoided the infringement; (d) any modification to the Software
@REM made without VMware's express written approval; (e) any claim that
@REM relates to open source software or freeware technology or any derivatives
@REM or other adaptations thereof that is not embedded by VMware into
@REM Software listed on VMware's commercial price list; or (f) any Software
@REM provided on a no charge, beta or evaluation basis.  THIS SECTION 8

@REM Confidential Information to the extent that such disclosure is required by
@REM law or by the order of a court of similar judicial or administrative body,
@REM provided that Recipient notifies Discloser of such required disclosure
@REM promptly and in writing and cooperates with Discloser, at Discloser's
@REM request and expense, in any lawful action to contest or limit the scope of
@REM such required disclosure.
@REM
@REM 11.4	Data Privacy.  You agree that VMware may process technical and
@REM related information about Your use of the Software which may include
@REM internet protocol address, hardware identification, operating system,
